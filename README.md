# ðŸ“š Libft - My 42 Core Library

Welcome to my **Libft** repository! This project was part of the **42 curriculum**, where I implemented my own version of essential C standard library functions. It served as a foundation for future projects at 42.

## âœ… Project Validation
- **Validated on:** December 1, 2023  
- **Final Score:** 124/100  
  - Achieved **the bonus part** ðŸŽ‰  
  - One corrector mistakenly gave **123 instead of 125**, leading to an unusual final score.

## ðŸš€ About Libft
Libft is a custom implementation of commonly used functions from `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, and more. It also includes additional utility functions that simplify C programming.

### ðŸ“‚ Main Features:
- **Standard Library Functions**: Reimplementations of functions like `memset`, `strdup`, and `atoi`.
- **Linked Lists Handling**: Custom functions for list manipulation (`ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`, etc.).

## ðŸ”§ Compilation
To compile the library, simply run:
```sh
make
